To run the tmp101 part, use THLset.sh to set the Thigh and Tlow first then run HW3HL.py. The board will start with two LEDs (red and green) turned on. Once a tmp101 reaches Thigh, the corresponding LED will be truned off. It will be turned back on when the temp drops below Tlow on that tmp101.

For the LED matrix part, run HW3Matrix.py. The matrix will first display a cute 8-bit piggy. Clean the matrix by pressing button MOD on board and control the cursor using four buttons that connected to GPIO pins.
